# Surfs_Up-

## Overview
The purpose of the SurfsUp! Analysis was to help gather important weather data for the specific months of June & December on the Hawaiian Island Oahu.  In this scenario we wanted to get into the surf shop business and had a potential business partner we wanted to wow with our SQLite skills.  With the use of SQLite and Jupyter notebooks we were able to create an application that held a wide range of weather data on where the best place would be to open a business would be.  The groundwork was laid out in the Climate_Analysis.ipynb file, in this example the temperature data was pulled from the months and visualized using the summary statistics function in pandas.

## Results
After pulling the temperature (TOBS) data and summarizing, we can see that between the two months (June, December) the average temperature very consistent.  This would be ideal information If you wanted to own a surf shop that doubled as an ice cream parlor, the year-round warm weather would be exactly what you would hope for.

## Summary
With all the data we collected its apparent that there is indeed an opportunity for your surf-shop/ice-cream parlor to thrive on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  The weather is consistent, and with that means your business should be as well. With this information, our business partner was anxious to get to work opening a new location!
